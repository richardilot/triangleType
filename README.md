#Project Software Engineering (Individual Assignment)
 Assignment week 3 for Project Software Engineering - Saxion University of Applied Sciences
 
 Write a Java program which is is able to determine the type of a triangle, based on the sides of a triangle. 
 There should be a triangle class, which has as attributes the lenght of the three sides of a triangle. 
 Based on the length of these sides, the triangle type should be determined. 
 Take care that your program is robust in the sense that it will not accept a set of three side lenghts, which does not obtain a valid triangle.

 Write also the necessary unit tests, in order to obtain a high code coverage.
